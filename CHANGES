Revision history for Perl module CPAN::Mini::Webserver:

0.51 Sat Jan 12 16:42:55 GMT 2011
     [ ENHANCEMENTS]
     - the display of recently added dists on the frontpage is now limited
       to 20 entries
     - changed the formatting of the depencency list on dist pages to be
       more readable
     - updated the stylesheet to the latest version

     [ BUGFIXES]
     - the server does not crash anymore while loading a dist that has
       dependencies that are unknown to the server
     - selecting the target for a package page is now a bit less naive so
       duplicate files don't cause wrong pages to be loaded. RT 44196

     [ CHANGES ]
     - using Capture::Tiny now instead of IO::Capture

     [ GENERAL CLEANUP ]

       performance-problematic algorithms

     - enabled use of the checksum files to get file dates
     - switched out the self-built mini cpan with ANDK's

       and Build.PL marked up as perl, not viewed as pod (patch
       by markf)
     - unbreak bonjour publishing (patch by miyagawa)
     - move the archive code into Archive::Peek and require it, with

     - improve the test suite (patch by markf)

       point CPAN or CPANPLUS at it (idea by markf)
     - refactor downloading distributions to use the CPAN codepath

0.39 Tue Aug 19 08:27:37 BST 2008

       (patch by martijn)
